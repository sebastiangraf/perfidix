Perfidix - No discussions, Just facts.
=============

Perfidix is a light-weight java library enabling users to benchmark sourcecode.
Similar to JUnit, annotations can be placed before methods.
Within the invocation of these methods, flexible measurements are performed.

6 steps how to use Perfidix
-------

1. Download the latest .jar from sourceforge or check out the latest build from the repository
2. Insert the jar into your classpath
3. Annotate your methods to bench with "@Bench". Note that these methods have to have the following layout: "public (final) void method()" 
4. Create a new "Benchmark" object and add the class with the annotated methods to it.
5. Get the BenchmarkResult by typing "benchmarkObj.run()"
6. Display the result with the TabularSummaryOutput.visit(benchmarkResultObj). 

For further documentation and as an example, please refer to the org.perfidix.example package.
